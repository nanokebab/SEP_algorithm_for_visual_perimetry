# SEP_algorithm_for_visual_perimetry

This repository contains some of the code I developed during my work at the ARTORG Center for Biomedical Engineering Research in 2016/17. This work lead to the following journal publication:

* Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science December 2017, Vol.58, 3414-3424. doi:https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.16-21144

These were  basically my first steps as a programmer, so code quality isn’t always the finest.

To run this code you have to place the two files VFPoints.csv and VisualFields.csv from the ‘Longitudinal Glaucomatous Visual Field data’ set  (ROTTERDAM OPHTHALMIC DATA REPOSITORY) in the data/raw/ folder. You can get the data set here:

Have fun :)
